First thing to do is straight up regression and stuff on the quality of the wine nothing special yet.

#setting up parameters
```{r}
#head(winequal)

#ressampling method:
#5 fold cross validation with 2 repeats
control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 2)

#test metric
metric <- "RMSE"

#data preprocessing
preProcess = c("center", "scale")
```

#shotgun ml models
```{r}
